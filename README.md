# AngularToulouse Meetups!

Welcome to AngularToulouse GitHub happy place!

Managing a meetup takes is a community effort!  We are trying to get more community involvement in choosing speakers and topics for our meetups.  What better way than creating a "Meetup Repository of Awesomeness"?!

###[Look at Proposed Topics](https://github.com/AngularToulouse/meetups/issues)
